# ClusterScan

ClusterScan is a powerful tool designed for the efficient management and monitoring of Kubernetes clusters. It automates the scanning and management processes, ensuring the smooth operation and security compliance of your Kubernetes environment.

## Description

ClusterScan utilizes several key technologies and tools to provide robust functionalities:

- **Kubernetes**: ClusterScan operates within Kubernetes environments, leveraging its extensibility and scalability features.
- **Kubebuilder**: This framework is used for building Kubernetes APIs using custom resource definitions (CRDs). It simplifies the process of creating Kubernetes-native applications and controllers.
- **Docker**: Used for containerizing the application, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
- **Kubectl**: The command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters. It is used for deploying and managing ClusterScan within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### Features

- **Automated Scanning**: ClusterScan periodically scans your Kubernetes clusters to ensure they adhere to predefined compliance and security standards.
- **Resource Management**: Provides tools to manage various Kubernetes resources efficiently, including pods, services, deployments, and more.
- **Custom Resources**: Leverages custom resource definitions to extend Kubernetes capabilities tailored to specific needs.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrates with other tools and services within the Kubernetes ecosystem.

### Technologies Used

- **Go**: The primary programming language used to develop ClusterScan, chosen for its performance and efficiency in handling concurrent tasks.
- **YAML**: Utilized for configuration files, allowing users to define and customize their ClusterScan setup easily.
- **Kubernetes API**: Interacts with the Kubernetes API to manage resources and perform operations within the cluster.
